# Project F8: Binary Prediction

The project comes from a Kaggle competition: Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio-Signals

Authors: Côme Quintyn, Kathleen Guillet

Goal 1: Develop a Machine Learning model with an AUC of at least 80%, to predict the smoking status of a person using bio signals.

Goal 2: Find correlations between features and labels and improve models (time taken to create the model, AUC…)
